Vehicle Data Cleaning Project
Overview
This project simulates a real-world data cleaning process applied to a vehicle dataset.
Although the dataset is simulated for confidentiality reasons, the data quality issues introduced (invalid number of doors, unrealistic engine displacements, inconsistencies between model_year and registration_date) mirror real challenges I have faced in professional environments.

The goal is to demonstrate advanced SQL-based data cleaning techniques, including validation rules, mode imputation, and business-rule-based corrections.

The project also includes visualization dashboards in Tableau to highlight the impact of data cleaning on business insights.

Database Schema
The schema models a relational vehicle registration system, including:

Brands (brands)
Lines (lines_name)
Versions (versions)
Body types (body_types)
Vehicle classes (vehicle_classes)
Cities (cities)
Service modes (service_mode)
Vehicle statuses (vehicle_statuses)
Vehicles (vehicles)
Full schema definition can be found in Schema_script.sql.

Data Cleaning Workflow
Data cleaning was applied step by step using SQL (cleaning_data.sql), focusing on variables commonly affected by inconsistencies in real-world datasets:

General Validations

Ensured referential integrity.
Validated that categorical values (classes, brands, body types, etc.) matched master tables.

Number of Doors (num_doors)

Motorcycles → always 0.
Cars & Pickups → valid range [2..5].
Trucks → valid range [1..4].
Out-of-range or null values replaced with the mode, using a fallback hierarchy:

(brand, line, version, body_type)
(vehicle_class, body_type)
(vehicle_class)

Engine Displacement (engine_displacement_cc)

Typical engine displacement calculated per (class, brand, line).
Class ranges defined:

Car → [800..3000]
Pickup → [2000..5000]
Truck → [4000..15000]
Motorcycle → [80..1500]

Special case: if motorcycle’s typical engine falls within [80..800], the valid range narrows to [80..800].
Out-of-range values updated with the most typical engine displacement for the group.

Model Year (model_year)

registration_date is assumed to be reliable (system-generated).
Valid ranges derived per (vehicle_class, brand, line, version) using only records where model_year = year(registration_date).

Updates applied when:

abs(model_year - year(registration_date)) > 2, or
model_year > current year + 1,
and year(registration_date) falls within the valid range.

Tools & Skills Demonstrated
SQL (MySQL 8)
Joins, subqueries, window functions, CTEs
Conditional updates with business rules
Data Quality Techniques
Mode imputation with fallback hierarchies
Range validation by category
Cross-variable consistency checks
Documentation & Communication
Clear step-by-step documentation of data cleaning workflow
Visualization (Tableau)
Impact of data cleaning on distributions and business KPIs

Tableau Dashboards
To showcase the results, dashboards were built in Tableau, including:
Before vs After Cleaning: Distribution of engine_displacement_cc, num_doors, and model_year.
Data Quality Impact: Percentage of invalid records corrected.
Vehicle Insights: Breakdown by brand, class, and city with cleaned data.

About the Data
The dataset is simulated for confidentiality reasons.
However, the issues introduced (invalid doors, unrealistic engine displacements, inconsistent model years) reflect real scenarios I have encountered in professional projects.

This ensures the project remains portfolio-safe while demonstrating realistic data cleaning challenges.

Results & Learnings
Reduced invalid values in key variables (num_doors, engine_displacement_cc, model_year) to 0%.

Applied business-rule-driven corrections to ensure data consistency.

Reinforced advanced SQL knowledge (CTEs, window functions, conditional updates).

Demonstrated ability to handle realistic data quality issues in vehicle registration datasets.
