 Step 6: Correct number of doors
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 üéØ Objective:
 - Standardize the variable `num_doors` according to vehicle type.

 üõ†Ô∏è Problem:
 - Motorcycles were assigned doors, which is invalid.
 - Cars and pickups had values outside the valid range [2‚Äì5].
 - Trucks had values outside the valid range [1‚Äì4].
 - Some vehicles had missing or extreme values without a mode.

 ‚úÖ Solution / Approach:
 - Motorcycles: assign 0 doors.
 - Cars and pickups:
     - If outside the range, assign the mode of 
       (brand, line, version, body_type).
     - If mode does not exist, fallback to mode of 
       (vehicle_class, body_type).
     - If still missing, fallback to mode of vehicle_class.
 - Trucks: same logic, but valid range [1‚Äì4].

 Step 7: Correct engine displacement (engine_displacement_cc)
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------
 üéØ Objective:
 - Ensure that engine displacement values are realistic for each vehicle class.

 üõ†Ô∏è Problem:
 - Some motorcycles had unrealistically high displacements (1000‚Äì3000 cc).
 - Some cars, pickups, and trucks had unrealistically small displacements (50‚Äì300 cc).

 ‚úÖ Solution / Approach:
 - Define a valid range per vehicle class.
 - Identify the most typical engine displacement per (class, brand, line).
 - If a value is outside the range:
     - Replace it with the typical displacement of that brand/line/class.
 - For motorcycles: if the typical displacement is within [80‚Äì800], 
   narrow the range to [80‚Äì800] to enforce stricter validation.

 - Some had a `model_year` later than (registration_year + 2).
 - Some even had model_year > current_year + 1.

 ‚úÖ Solution / Approach:
 - Build valid ranges per (vehicle_class, brand, line, version) 
   based only on records where `model_year = registration_year`.
 - If `model_year` differs significantly from registration_year:
     - Replace with registration_year if it falls within the valid range.
 - Additional rule: if model_year > current_year + 1, 
   always replace with registration_year.
